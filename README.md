Plugin for Intellij IDEA.

Gives you one-stroke way to navigate to next/previous identifier occurrence.

Use Shift+Alt+Up and Shift+Alt+Down to navigate up and down to each identifier occurrence.

Make sure that these shortcuts are not mapped to e.g. "Move Line Up" and "Move Line Down" in Keymap.

Can be used with or without "Highlight usages of element at caret" enabled.
